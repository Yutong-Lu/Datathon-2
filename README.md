# Datathon-2

## Research questions

1. Is there an association between average blood sugar and stroke?
2. Can we use KNN/logistic regression machine learning model to predict stroke?
3. K-means on Mortality Dataset for Cardiovascular Disease Complications

## Analysis Plan

### Features: 
* main exposure: average blood sugar
* Covariates: gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, work type, residence type, bmi, smoking status
* Outcome: stroke
* Model: KNN/logistic

### Data Processing 
* Data cleaning, exploration
* Remove observations with missing values/unknowns
* Create dummy variables for work_type, resident type, gender, smoking status

### Training and test data
* Feature selection: heatmap, likelihood ratio tests
* Visualization
